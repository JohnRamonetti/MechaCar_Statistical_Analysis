## [Linear Regression to Predict MPG](Images/1_lmSummary.png)

  - Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
      Of the variables tested (vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance and AWD), only vehicle length (p= 2.60e-12) and ground clearance (p= 5.21e-08) showed a statistically significant correlation with MPG, in this dataset.
      
  
  - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
      The p-value of our multiple linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is very small and statistically significant (at the .001% level).  Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.  A significant linear relationsip exists.
  
  - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
      From our linear regression model, the r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (MPG) is explained using this linear model.  While this is fairly predictive, our Intercept is also statistically significant (p= 5.08e-08), so 1) the significant features (vehicle length and ground clearance) may need scaling or transforming to help improve the predictive power of the model, and/or 2) there may be other variables that can help explain the variability of MPG that have not been included in our model.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

   - The design specifications for MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.  Overall, as shown in our [PSI Total Summary](Images/2_total_summary.png), metrics are within acceptable ranges for manufacturing lots in total.  However, for individual lots, as shown in the [PSI Lot Summary](Images/2_lot_summary.png), there is unacceptable variation in PSI.  Specifically, the PSI variance in Manufacturing Lot 3 shows a variance of 170 PSI, well above the maximum allowed.  Lot 3, therefore, does not meet the design specifications.


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Across all lots - p-value = 0.06028.  Cannot reject null hypothesis.
